## Installation
Install the dependencies:
```bash
 conda env create -f environment/environment.yml
```
Read [`environment/helper.txt`](./environment/helper.txt) if some libraries can't be installed.

## Usage
To train the model, run the following command:
```bash
python train.py configs/meld.yaml       # for MELD
python train.py configs/iemocap6.yaml   # for IEMOCAP
```
